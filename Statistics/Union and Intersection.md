### Intersection$$A\cap B$$
- The intersection of two events is the crossover in their Venn diagram
- This is essentially the same as the $\land$ operator
$$\Large P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(A)*P(B|A)*P(C|(A\cap B))$$
### Union$$A\cup B$$
- The union of two events, denoted by $A\cup B$ , is just the or operator
- The Intersection of two events,
- This includes everything in each event and their intersection

##### Probability of a Union$$P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
- The probability of a Union is
