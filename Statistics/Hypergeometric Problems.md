### $$P(A_k)= \frac{\binom{R}k\binom{N-R}{n-k}}{\binom{N}n} $$
Used when we want k of a group in a space of n things from a sample space of N things with R number of what we want and n

We can think of it as two buckets

We have a bucket with 50 (N) balls, 25 (R) red balls and 25 blue balls, and we have a second bucket that can contain 13 (R) balls and  we want to see the probability that
