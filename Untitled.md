$\large \int_{a}^{b} 1dx =$ length of $\large [a,b]$

so

$\large \int \int_{D} 1dA =$  area of D

and

$\large \int \int\int_{D}1dV =$ volume of D

# Examples

$\large D$ is the region bounded by $\large y=x^{2}-2$ and $\large y=x$ 
Find the area of D

![[area-of-some-region-ex.png]]

This region is either vertically simple.

To get the vertically boundaries we need to solve

$\large x^{2}-2 =x$

This gives $\large x = 2, x=-1$ for the boundaries
