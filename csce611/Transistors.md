#### nMOS
n-type channels, p-type substrate

#### pMOS
p-type channels, n-type substrate

We designate one of the channels as the drain(-) and the other as the source(+)



Gates can be made with p and n type transistors, but they have restraints

for any 1 output there needs to be at least one 0 input  and vice verso
