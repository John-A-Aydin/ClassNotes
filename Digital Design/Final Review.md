- Mostly code questions

#### RARS
- Jumps are two cycles
- Add two to num of instructions bc of the 3 cycles

#### Describe the process by which a user-entered HDL design is converted to a form that may be loaded onto an FPGA

- The code is synthesised into a graph called the netlist and then the netlist is mapped to the FPGA.
- Once its mapped each node needs to be connected on the FPGA

### Sequential

D-latch vs D-flipflop



Look back at ripple carry adder bs
- Carry ins and all that junk
- Carry ins (CI), Carry outs (CO)
- Generate and Propogate

For CI3
CI3 = G2 + P2 G1 (or smth like this)


### Prefix adder??? wtf is this shit
