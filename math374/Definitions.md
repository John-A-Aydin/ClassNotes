Definitions provide restrictions on numbers to allow us to formulate Proofs
##### Ex.
- n is a perfect square :  n is a natural number
	- $\exists$ k integer such that $k^2=n$
- p is prime 
	- if $p>1$ (positive integer)
	- if $p=a*b$ with a, b being integers, 
		- then $a=1$ or $b=1$
- n is a composite number
	- if $n\ge 2$
	- n is not a prime
