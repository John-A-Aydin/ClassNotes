### $$\{Q\} P \{R\}$$
- Q and R are statements
	- Q is a statement about the variables before the program runs (==Precondition==)
	- R is a statement about the input and output of the program (==Postcondition==)
- P is the program
- Traversal:$$\{Q\}, e_1, \{Q_1\}, e_2, \{Q_2\}, ..., e_{k-1}, \{Q_{k-1}\}, e_k, \{R\}$$
	- We are verifying every line of the program
##### $$l_i$$
- In each iteration we are saying $x\leftarrow e$ (write e into x)

### Where P is an *Assignment*


### Where P is a *Conditional*


### Where P is a *Loop*
