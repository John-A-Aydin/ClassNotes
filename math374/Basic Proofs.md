##### Sum of even integers is even
$\forall x \forall y (x$ even $\land y$ even $\rightarrow x+y$ even) 
By the definition of even numbers $\exists n$ integer, m integer such that 

This is a direct proof


##### Product of odd integers is odd

Proof:
Assume x, y are arbitrary odd integers
By the definition of odd integers $$x=2k+1$$$$y=2l+1$$where l and k are integers$$x*y=(2k+1)(2l+1)=2k*2l+2k+2l+1= 2(2kl+l+k)+1$$since $2kl+l+k$ is an integer $x*y$ can be written as $2*n+1$ where n is some integer.   


##### If $n^2$ is odd then n is odd

We will use Contraposition$$p\rightarrow q\Leftrightarrow q'\rightarrow p'$$we have to prove that
$\forall$n(n is not odd $\rightarrow$ n$^2$ is not odd )
$\forall$n(n is even $\rightarrow$ n$^2$ is even )
$$n=2k$$$$n^2=(2k)^2$$
