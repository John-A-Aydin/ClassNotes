Assume $\large P,\le \text{is a finite partial order}$ 

Def.
$\large a\in P \text{ is the min element if }\forall b\in P \text{, }a\le b$

$\large c\in P \text{ is the minimal element if }\forall x (x\le c\rightarrow x=c)$ 

[[Topological Sorting]] 

$\large\exists \{v_{1}, v_{2}, \text{ ... }, v_{u}\} = P$
$\large \forall i,j (v_{i}\le v_{j}\rightarrow i\le j)$ 

Consider P
P has a minimal element c

Now we consider P - c (removing c from the partial order)


The relation P doesn't need to be $\le$, it can be any ordered relation
