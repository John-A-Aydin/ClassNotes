##### If interest rates drop, then the housing market will improve.
##### Either the federal discount rate will drop, or the housing market will not improve.
##### Interest rates will drop.
##### Therefore the federal discount rate will drop

Statements 1-3 are implied to have ands between them.

I - Interest rates will drop
H - Housing market will improve
F - Federal  discount rate will drop

##### Written as a logical expression:
##### $$ (I \rightarrow H) \land (F \lor H') \land I \rightarrow F$$
To determine it's validity we have to determine if this is a [[Tautology]].

1. $I\rightarrow H$ 
	- Hyp
2. $F \lor H$ Hyp
3. I
4. H
5. F
