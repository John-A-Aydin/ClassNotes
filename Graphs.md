##### Sparse
- Few edges between  verticies
##### Dense
- Nearly at capacity for edges



##### Connected
- There exists a path between each pair of vertices (no lonely guys)

##### Complete
- Every vertex is connected to every other vertex

### How to represent a graph

##### Adjacency Table

Good for dense graphs

|  | a | b | c |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| a | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| b | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| c | 0 | 1 | 0 |

Notice the diagonal symmetry for an undirected graph (NOT FOR DIRECTED GRAPHS)

##### Adjacency Linked List

Good for sparse graphs
