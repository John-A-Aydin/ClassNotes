#### Reasons to use RAID
1. Speed
2. Reliability

# Raid Levels
### Raid Level 0
- Used to string multiple drives together
- Makes multiple drives appear as one large drive
- Less reliable than a single disk

Level 0 spreads blocks of data across the disks in round-robin fashion


### Raid Level 1
- Uses mirroring for redundancy



### Raid Levels 4 & 5
- Parity based redundancy
