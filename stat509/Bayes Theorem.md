$$\Large P(A_j|B) = \frac{P(A_j)P(B|A_j)}{\sum^n_{i=1}P(A_i)P(B|A_i)} = \frac{P(A_j)P(B|A_j)}{P(B)}$$
If we want to find the probability of an event *A* given *B*, where *A* came before *B* and *B* is dependent on *A*, we calculate the above equation.

Middle expression uses [[Theorem of Total Probability]] to find the probability of *B*.
