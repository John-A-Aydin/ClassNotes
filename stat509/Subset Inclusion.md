- Two events, $A$ and $B$ in $\Omega$ are said to be equal ($A=B$), if they contain the same elements.
- $A$ is said to be a subset of $B$ ($A\subseteq B$), if every element of $A$ belongs to $B$ 

How event equality relates to event inclusion
$$(A=B) \Leftrightarrow [(A\subseteq B)\land (B\subseteq A)]$$
