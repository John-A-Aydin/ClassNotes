### Fundamental Theorem of Counting

If we haves [[Sample Space]]s with unique and unrelated outcomes the total number of possible outcomes is $$\prod N_i$$
where $N_i$ is the number of outcomes in each sample space.

##### Ex. 
 If we generate 8 random bits, we know the number of possible outcomes for each sample space is two. Therefore the total number of possible outcomes would be $$2^8 = 256$$
##### Ex.
If we roll a die 4 times what is the probability of getting at least one 6 ($P_6$)
$$P_6= 1-P_{!6}$$
We can reverse the probability we are calculating to apply the FTC
$$P_6= 1- \frac{(5)(5)(5)(5)}{(6)(6)(6)(6)}= 0.51\overline{77}$$

 This applies to all experiments that ask to find the probability of getting at least one of something.
