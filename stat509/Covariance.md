If X and Y are dependent
$$\Large \sigma_{xy} = E(xy)- (\mu_x)(\mu_y)$$
1. The covariance of x and x is just the [[Standard Deviation]] of x $$\Large \sigma_{xx} = \sigma^2_{x}$$
2. if X and Y are independent $$\Large \sigma_{xy} = 0$$
3. $\sigma_{xy}$ measures the degree of linear association between X and Y
