# $s, \omega$ 
- Denote the possible elementary outcomes
## $S, \Omega$ 
- Denote the totality of all possible elementary outcomes (Sample Space)

##### Ex 1.
- Tossing a coin
$$ S=\{H,T\}$$
##### Ex 2.
- Someone tosses a coin until a Heads occurs
$$S=\{H, TH, TTH, TTTH, TTTTH ...\}$$
- Produces a countable number of outcomes
- The probability of each outcome occurring is the product of the probabilities of its individual components
$$\frac{1}2 + \left(\frac{1}2\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}2\right)^3+ \left(\frac{1}2\right)^4+ ...$$
- This is just a geometric series and can be solved easily.

### Discrete Sample Space

- The sum of all of the probabilities of elementary outcomes is 1
- 
##### Finite Sample Space $$\Omega = \{w_1, w_2, ...,w_n\}$$
##### Probability of an [[Elementary Events]] $$p_i = P_r(\{w_i\})= \frac{1}N$$
##### Probability  of an Event $$P(A) = \frac{(\# of A)}N$$
##### If A is a subset of S: $A\subset S$
$$P(A) = \sum P_i$$ $$\{i: s_i \in A\}$$
