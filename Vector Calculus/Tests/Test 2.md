No double integrals over rectangles or triple integrals over box's

### [[Non-Rectangular Regions]]
- Remember vertically vs horizontally simple integration orders
- Could ask to switch the order of integration
- Remember the area formula for a 2d region
- Draw the region of integration
### [[Regions Defined by  Polar Coordinates]]
- Recognize when to use polar coordinates
- Remember area formula for polar coordinates
#### Some functions the scream polar
$\large (x-a)^{2} + (y-b)^{2} = r^{2}$
$\large y = \sqrt{16-x^{2}}$   or   $\large y = -\sqrt{16 - x^{2}}$

$\large 16 = y^{2} + x^{2}$

### [[Non-boxy Regions]]
- Look at pyramid example
	- May need to find the equation of a plane given 3 points

### [[Regions Defined by Cylindrical Coordinates]]
- May be given a verbal description of the graph
$\large z = \sqrt{ x^{2} + y^{2}}$    is a cone
$\large z = x^{2} + y^{2}$  is a paraboloid

$\large z = 4-x^{2}-y^{2}$
is a paraboloid that is shifted down 4 units and flipped upside down

### [[Regions Defined by Spherical Coordinates]]

$\large x^{2} +y^{2}+z^{2} = 25$ 
probably means we need to use spherical

$\large z = \pm \sqrt{25 - x^{2} -y^{2}}$
