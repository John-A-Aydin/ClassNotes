Be able to compute limits of functions of 2 or more variables

Be able to show a limit does not exist using the [[Two Path Test]]
- Make sure to write a small conclusion
- find the right direction

==GUARANTEED==
When we get $\large \frac{0}{0}$ there is no l'Hopital
- Use algebra 
	- multiply by  the conjugate
	- get a common denominator

[[Partial Derivatives]]

Brush up on trig and basic derivatives

# 14.4

[[Chain Rule(s)]]

Look over the tree diagram

Final answer should be expressed in terms of the variables at the bottom of the tree

[[Implicit Differentiation]]

# 14.5

[[Directional Derivatives]]

make sure the direction vector is a unit vector

2 ways this could be asked
1. Find the directional derivative of $\large f(x,y)$ in some direction
2. Find the value of the directional derivative at a point $\large P_{0}$

ANSWER WILL BE SCALAR

[[Gradient]]

Know the physical/geometric interpretation of the gradient

Ant problem?

==LOOK THIS SHIT UP==

Gradient tells us the direction of steepest ascent at any given point.

Moving in the direction of the gradient will get us up the hill the fastest

$\large ||\nabla f||$  = rate of increase

This will be a word problem
# 14.6

[[Tangent Planes]]

1. $\large z=f(x,y)$
2. $\large f(x,y,z) = C$
$\large f_{x}(P_{0})(x-x_{0})$ ...
Only bother to remember the equation for $\large f(x,y,z)$

# 14.7 (Local Extrema)

[[The Second Partials Test]]

1. Find stationary points
2. Discriminate
3. Categorize stationary points

Remember the different cases

NONLINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
# 14.8 (Absolute Extrema)

[[Lagrange Multipliers]]

Look for key words
- Local (14.7)
- Absolute (14.8) will give constraint

Solve the system of equations with the constraint in mind

We don't need to find $\large \lambda$ but it may help
