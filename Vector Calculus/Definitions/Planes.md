There are two ways to find the eqn of a plane

1. A point on the plane and the normal vector
2. Three points that lie on the plane


# 1

The equation of the plane with normal vector $\large \vec{N} = \langle1,-1,1\rangle$ containing $\large P = (0,0,0)$ is found by connecting any arbitrary pint on the plane $\large (x,y,z)$ to $\large P$

$\large \langle x,y,z \rangle$

The normal vector $\large \vec{N}$ is orthogonal to this vector
$\large \vec{N} * \langle x,y,x \rangle = 0$
$\large \langle 1,-1,1 \rangle * \langle x,y,z \rangle = 0$
$\large x-y+z=0$

# Finding the equation of a plane with three points

The three points can be used to create 2 vectors.

### Example

$\large P = (0,0,0)$
$\large Q = (1,1,0)$
$\large R=  (0,1,1)$

$\large \vec{PQ} = \langle 1-0, 1-0, 0-0\rangle = \langle1,1,0\rangle$
$\large \vec{PR} =\langle 0,1,1 \rangle$

We need a point on the plane and the normal vector to turn this into the first case
$\large \vec{N} = \vec{PQ} \times \vec{PR}$
This can be found with the [[Determinant|determinant]]

$\large \vec{N} = \langle1,-1,1\rangle$
