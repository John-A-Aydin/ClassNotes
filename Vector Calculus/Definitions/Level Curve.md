The set of all points (x,y) that satisfy $\large f(x,y)=C$ for some constant C is called a level curve of f(x,y).

Looking at it geometrically shows that it is the set of all points where a surface $\large f(x,y)$ intersects the flat plane $\large C$

Think of those maps with lines that show height. The mountains / hills are just a multi-variable function and the lines are just level curves
