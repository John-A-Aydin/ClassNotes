Points on a function $\large f$ where the [[Gradient|gradient]] is equal to the zero vector.
$\large \nabla f = \vec{0}$

Stationary points can be either [[Extrema|extrema]]  or  [[Saddle Points|saddle points]]. We can tell the difference by making sure the first derivative in every direction has the same sign.

If it has the same sign in every direction it is an extrema, if not it's a saddle point.
