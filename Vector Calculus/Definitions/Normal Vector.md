The normal vector of a surface at any given point $\large P_{0}$ is a vector that is 90 degrees from the surface's [[Tangent Planes|tangent plane]] at $\large P_{0}$

### Principle Unit Normal Vector

The principle unit normal vector is calculated with the [[Tangent and Normal Vectors of VVF|unit tangent vector]]
$$\large \vec{N}(t) = \frac{\vec{T}'(t)}{||\vec{T}'(t)||}$$
$\large \vec{N}(t)$ points in the direction the object is turningprinincople
