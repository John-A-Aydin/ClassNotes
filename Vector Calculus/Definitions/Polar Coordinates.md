Standard (Cartesian) coordinates describe a point by  saying it is x to the right and y units up

Polar coordinates describe a point by making it a point on the radius of some circle.

Notice that if we are describing this point in terms of (x,y), $\large r$ is just the hypotenuse of the triangle made by  x and y

This gives us:

$\large \cos \theta = \frac{x}{r}$
$\large \sin \theta = \frac{y}{r}$
$\large \tan \theta =\frac{y}{x}$

If we know $\large r$ and $\large \theta$:

$\large x = r \cos \theta$
$\large y= r \sin \theta$

If we know x and y:

$\large r = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
$\large \theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$
