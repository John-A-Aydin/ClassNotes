Recall that $\large f_{x}$ and $\large f_{y}$ measure the rate of change of $\large f(x,y)$ in the x and y <u>directions</u> respectively

**The direction of x axis is a vector**

The vector that represents the x axis is the i vector

In 2d,  $\large \vec{i} = \hat{i} = \langle1, 0\rangle$ 

In 3d,  $\large\hat{i} = \langle1, 0, 0\rangle$ 

Remember $\large (1,0) \ne \langle1,0\rangle$
- $\large(1,0)$ represents a point
- $\large \langle1,0\rangle$ represents the vector connecting $\large(0,0)$ and $\large (1,0)$

**The direction of y axis is also  a vector**

In 2d,  $\large \vec{j} = \hat{j} = \langle0,1\rangle$

In 3d,  $\large \hat{j} = \langle0,1,0\rangle$

##### Why use $\large\hat{i}$ and $\large\hat{j}$?

Every vector with 2 components can be written in terms of $\large\hat{i}$ and $\large\hat{j}$ using [[Vectors#Operations on Vectors|vector operations]]

In 2d, $\large\hat{i}\text{ }\hat{j}$ are called the [[Standard Basis Vectors]] for $\large \mathbb{R}^{2}$

In 3d, we also use $\large\hat{k}$
