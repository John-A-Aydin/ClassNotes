A test to determine if a [[Vector-Valued Function]] is conservative.

Let $\large \vec{F}(x,y) = \langle M(x,y), N(x,y) \rangle$
Then $\large \vec{F}$ is conservative iff
$$\large \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$$

# In Higher Dimensions

$\large \vec{F}$ is conservative iff $\large \vec{F}$ has 0 [[Curl|curl]]
$$\large \text{curl}\vec{F} = \nabla \times \vec{F} = \vec{0}$$
