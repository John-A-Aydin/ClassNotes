Let $\large C$ be a smooth curve given by
$\large \vec{r}(t) \text{ , } a \le t \le b$
which begins at $\large \vec{r}(a)$ and ends at $\large \vec{r}(b)$.

If the scalar function $\large f$ is differentiable, then
$$\large \int_{C} \nabla f \cdot d \vec{r} = f(b) - f(a)$$
We can think of the [[Gradient|gradient]] of $\large f$ as a derivative that cancels out the [[Line or Path Integral|path integral]].

If $\large \vec{F}$ satisfies $\large \nabla f =$
