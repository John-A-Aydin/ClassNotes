Let $\large C$ be a curve defined by
$\large \vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$,   $\large a \le t \le b$

We know that the [[Derivatives of Vector Valued Functions|derivative]] of $\large \vec{r}(t)$  shows us the direction of the curve and the [[Tangent and Normal Vectors of VVF|tangent vector]] of $\large \vec{r}'(t)$,  $\large \vec{T}'(t)$,  shows //IDK//

Define the scalar function $\large \kappa(t)$ to measure the curvature of $\large C$ at any point along this trajectory.

There are a lot of methods to find this curvature, but we will cover two.

##### Method 1:
$$\large \kappa(t) = \frac{||\vec{T}'(t)||}{||\vec{r}'(t)||}$$

##### Method 2:
$$\large \kappa(t) = \frac{||\vec{r}'(t) \times \vec{r}''(t)||}{||\vec{r}'(t)||^{3}}$$

### Example 1

Find the curvature of
$\large \vec{r}(t) = \langle t, t^{2},t^{3} \rangle$
at any point and at $\large t = 0$
