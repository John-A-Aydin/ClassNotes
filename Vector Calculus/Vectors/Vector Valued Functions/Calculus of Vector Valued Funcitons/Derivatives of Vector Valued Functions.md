A curve $\large C$ is parameterized by 
$\large x = x(t)$
$\large y = y(t)$
$\large a \le t \le b$
$\large \downarrow$
$\large \vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$ ,  $\large a \le t \le b$

What is the derivative of $\large \vec{r}(t)$ ?
$\large \vec{r}'(t) = \langle x'(t), y'(t) \rangle$
so
$\large \vec{r}'(t)$ is the [[Unit Tangent Vector of VVF|tangent vector]] to the curve $\large C$ at any given point.

A good interpretation of this is looking at $\large \vec{r}(t)$ as the position, and $\large \vec{r}'(t)$ as the velocity

For computing these derivatives see [[Derivative Rules for Vector Valued Functions]].
