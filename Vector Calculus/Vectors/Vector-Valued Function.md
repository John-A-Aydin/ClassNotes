A vector-valued function (VVF) is a function whose domain is $\large \mathbb{R}$ and range is all of (or a subset of) $\large \mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $\large d \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
$$\large \vec{F} : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}, d = 2,3,4 ...$$
A VVF $\large \vec{F}(t)$ has components that are scalar functions:$$\large \vec{F}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle$$
### What does the graph of a VVF look like?

It is the set of all points that $\large \vec{F}(t)$ points to for some value of $\large t$
Any doodle or drawing can be expressed as a VVF.

Every point on the doodle would correspond to some value of $\large t$

$\large t$ can be thought of as time, we cant physically see it on the graph, but it is there.
### Example 1

$\large \vec{F}(t) = \langle t, \sin(t), e^{t} \rangle$

$\large \vec{F}(0)  = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle$
so: $\large 0 \rightarrow \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle$

### Example 2

$\large \vec{F}(t) = \langle \cos(t), \sin(t), t \rangle = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle$

$\large x(t) = \cos(t)$   $\large y(t) = \sin(t)$   $\large z(t) = t$
Are parametric equations

Note:
$\large x^{2}(t) + y^{2}(t) = 1 \Rightarrow x^{2}+y^{2} = 1$
and
$\large z(t) = t$ means wear stretching the function up and down

This function is just the equation for a slinky
