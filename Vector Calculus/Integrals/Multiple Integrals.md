$$\large \int \int f(x,y) dx dy \Leftrightarrow \int \int f(x,y) dydx$$

For a multi variable integral we have $\large n!$ orders of computing it.
Some of these orders of integration are harder than others, especially when integrating over [[Non-boxy Regions|non-boxy regions]].

The main challenge will be setting up the limits of integration.
