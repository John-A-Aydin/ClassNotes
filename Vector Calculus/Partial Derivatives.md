In Calc 1 $\large y=f(x)$ may have 1 first derivative

Now, $\large z = f(x,y)$ will have 2 first derivatives

Since we have multiple first derivatives we need a notation to express this

##### Notation:
$\large Z_{x}$
$\large f_{x}$

### Definition
$$\Large $$


# Geometric Interpretation

In a normal derivative, $\large \frac{dy}{dx}$represents the slope of the tangent line or rate of change at any point.

Now, consider the 3d surface given by $\large z=f(x,y)$ (a curved 2d surface in 3d space)

The plane $\large y = y_{0}$ slices through $\large f(x,y)$ to produce a 2d curve.

For $\large\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}$ we are just looking at the slope of the tangent line in the x-direction for any curve obtained by choosing a $\large y_{0}$

By looking at $\large \frac{\partial x}{\partial z}$ and $\large \frac{\partial y}{\partial z}$ we can construct vectors that represent the "direction" of the surface at any given point.
