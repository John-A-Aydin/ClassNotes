$\Large f: D\rightarrow R$

D and R can be multidimensional
- For two dimensions it would be the [[Cartesian Product]] (Ordered pair)

### Finding Domains

$\Large \frac{1}{xy}$
- Domain: all (x,y) where $x\ne0\land y\ne0$ 

$\Large \sqrt{y-x^{2}}$
- Domain: all (x,y) where $y\ge x^{2}$

### Graphing functions of 2 variables

If we set one of the variables to be constant and look at the other two, we can look at a cross section of the graph

**Ex**
$\large z= x^{2}+y^{2}$
Setting y to 0 will show us a 2d cross section of the shape on the y axis

#### Def
The set of all points (x,y) that satisfy $\large f(x,y)=C$ for some constant C is called a level curve of f(x,y).

Think of those maps with lines that show height. The mountains / hills are just a multivariable function and the lines are just level curves
