$\Large f: D\rightarrow R$

D and R can be multidimensional
- For two dimensions we can think of it as a [[Cartesian Product]] (Ordered pair)

### Finding Domains

$\Large \frac{1}{xy}$
- Domain: all (x,y) where $x\ne0\land y\ne0$ 

$\Large \sqrt{y-x^{2}}$
- Domain: all (x,y) where $y\ge x^{2}$

### Graphing functions of 2 variables

If we set one of the variables to be constant and look at the other two, we can look at a cross section of the graph

**Ex**
$\large z= x^{2}+y^{2}$
Setting y to 0 will show us a 2d cross section of the shape on the y axis

We can also set $\large z$, the dependent variable to a constant.
This gives us a [[Level Curve]]

### 4d Shapes

We cannot produce a standard [[Level Curve]] for a function of the following form
$\large f = f(x, y, z)$ 

Instead we create level surfaces which are 3 dimensional
These follow the same equation as level curves.

**Ex**

$\large f(x,y,z) = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$

$\large x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=C$

The level surfaces of this 4d shape is a set of concentric spheres
