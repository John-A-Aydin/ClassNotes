The equation of the plane that is tangent to the surface $\large z = f(x,y)$ containing the point $\large P_{0} = (x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ is given by$$\large f_{x}(x_{0}, y_{0})(x-x_{0})+f_{y}(x_{0},y_{0})(y-y_{0}) - (z-z_{0}) = 0$$


The equation of the plane tangent to the level surface $\large f(x,y,z) = C$  at a point $\large P_{0} = (x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ is$$\large f_{x}(P_{0})(x-x_{0}) + f_{y}(P_{0})(y-y_{0})+f_{z}(P_{0})(z-z_{0}) = 0$$
or$$\large \nabla f(P_{0})\cdot \langle x-x_{0}, y-y_{0,}z-z_{0}\rangle$$


### Example 3

Find the equation of the plane that is tangent to
$\large z = x^{2} +y^{2}$  at  $(1,1)$ 

First find $\large z_{0} = x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2} = 2$

$\large f_{x} = 2x$  so $f_{x}(P_{0}) = 2$

$\large f_{y} = 2y$  so  $\large f_{y}(P_{0}) = 2$

so the answer is:

$\large 2(x-1) + 2(y-1) - (z-2) = 0$

### Example 2

Find the equation of the plane tangent to
$\large x^{2} + y^{2}-z^{2} = 24$ at $\large (3,-4,1)$

First we compute the partial derivatives

$\large f_{x} = 2x$
$\large f_{y} = 2y$
$\large f_{z} = -2z$

Then we solve these for out point of interest and plug them into the formula
