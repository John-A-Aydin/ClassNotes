The current across an inductor cannot instantly change.
#### $$ v = L \frac{di}{dt} $$
or
#### $$ i = \frac{1}L \int_{t_0}^t v(t)dt+i(t_0) $$
The Inductor Law tells us that the voltage through a capacitor is directly proportional to the [[Inductance]] and the derivative of the current.

#### Magnetic [[Energy]] Stored
#### $$ w = \frac{1}2Li^2 $$

#### [[DC]]
- Inductors act as a normal wire in DC circuits 

### Time Constant ($\tau$)$$\tau=\frac{L}{R}$$
### Current

# After Switch On$$I_t = I_f(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}})$$
Where tau is the [[Characteristic Time Constant]]
